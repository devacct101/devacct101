## Well, hello there👋

This is my Github development account which is used to host a mix of private and public repositories for personal development. 

It is mostly focused around data science, Python and API development.

## My skills:

### Hard Skills:
* ➗ Data science (R, Python)
* 👓 Data integration API Development (Python)
* 💻 Data Querying with SQL, PySpark

### Project Examples:

These projects aren't designed to be a full show case of skills, more a useful knowledge store for documenting techologies for personal use.
